# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [0.4.1] 2023-07-22

### Added

- Better context window handling. Old messages are now redacted based on the context window usage and token buffer. These can be changed with `--context-window [TOKENS]` and `--token-buffer [TOKENS]`. For example, GPT-4 can be run with a 4K context window to save money: `--model 4 --context-window 4000`
- Support for when OpenAI drops `-0613` from model names
- Limit autonomous function calls to 10 in order to prevent infinite function loop. Limit can be changed with `--loop-limit [NUMBER]`

### Fixed

- Forcing command to be run synchronously or asynchronously

### Changed

- Git commit is now made after every run command as well when using the `--git` flag

## [0.4.0] 2023-07-07

### Added

- A system message for creating PowerPoint presentations using Marp
- Ability to refuse commands ChatGPT wants to run with a message to ChatGPT
- Improved cross-platform support
- Creation of a project outline in the beginning of the project. Can be skipped with `--no-outline` or used automatically with `--use-outline`
- `--git` flag to initialize a Git repository in the project automatically and commit every task. Commit message generation can be disabled with `--no-commit-msg` if you don't want to generate a commit message with GPT
- `--simple` flag for running simple prompts quickly
- `--no-cmd` flag to disable the `run_cmd` function from ChatGPT
- `--zip` flag to create a zip file of the project instead of writing files directly (`--no-cmd` is added automatically). When this flag is used, files are created only in memory and saved to a zip file in the end. An optional filename or full path of a zip file can be provided.
- Token saver module that redacts redundant file read and write messages from the message history. The "savings rate" of the token saver can be changed by changing `--token-saver-level` (lower number saves more, default 3).

### Changed

- Changed default model to `gpt-3.5-turbo-16k-0613"
- Updated system messages
- Improved tasklist creation
- Moved modules to `modules` directory

### Removed

- Disabled `append_file` and `replace_text` functions because GPT used them wrong often

## [0.3.0]

### Added

- Ability to set default command line flags in `config.json`
- `--step-by-step` flag to run tasklist step by step as separate messages to GPT
- Ability to modify original prompt iteratively with GPT
- Confirmation before detecting custom system message with GPT
- Ability to skip a tasklist entirely
- System message for PHP websites

### Fixed

- Enforcement of the `--questions` flag even when GPT responds with more questions
- Exception when no output was generated from a failed terminal command
- System message was detected again for each version when using `--versions`
- Initial clarifying questions now are added to each version when using `--versions`
- The tasklist is now added to each version when using `--versions`

### Changed

- By default, GPT-AutoPilot will ask whether you want to go through the tasklist step by step or as a single message. You can change this behavior with the flags `--step-by-step` and `--single-tasklist`
- Changed the prompt for the system prompt detector
- Clarification questions and their answers are now added to message history as actual assistant/user messages instead of a combined Q/A message.
- Only the final tasklist after changes is kept in the message history
- Unanswered clarifying questions are omitted from the message history and not sent to GPT
- Default temperature from `0.9` to `1.0`

## [0.2.0] 2023-06-29

### Added

- Ability to run the script from outside the script directory
- More command line flags:
    - `--dir [DIRECTORY]` to use a custom project folder for reading/writing instead of the `code` folder
    - `--create-dir` to create project directory automatically if it doesn't exist
    - `--prompt-file [FILENAME]` to load the first prompt from a file
    - `--allow-cmd [EXACT_COMMAND]` to allow specific terminal commands to be run without confirmation
    - `--one-task` to end script after the first 'task is finished' summary
    - `--max-tokens [NUMBER]` to limit the maximum number of tokens the project can use
    - `--max-price [NUMBER]` to limit the maximum amount of money the project can use
    - `--continue` to continue automatically if ChatGPT responds without a function call
    - `--model [MODEL_NAME]` to set the ChatGPT API model to be used
- GPT-AutoPilot will now ask 5 questions about the project in the beginning, before starting to code. The behavior can be changed with the following command line flags:
    - `--no-questions` to not ask any questions
    - `--questions [NUMBER]` to set number of questions to ask
- GPT-AutoPilot now creates a task list for the project and runs through the list one by one. You can use the following command line flags to change the behavior:
    - `--no-tasklist` to not generate a task list at all
    - `--single-tasklist` to send the whole tasklist to ChatGPT at once
- Custom system messages and checklists for specific projects. A fitting system message from the `prompts` folder is picked automatically and can be changed with these command line flags:
    - `--system [SYSTEM_MESSAGE_SLUG]` to set which system message from `prompts` folder is used
    - `--use-system` to not ask for confirmation before using an automatically detected system message
    - `--do-checklist` to do all tasks in the checklist automatically after the project is finished
    - `--no-checklist` to not use any checklist
- Rudamentary tests for sample projects

### Fixed

- Issues with GPT-3.5 model
- Fixed and "fixed" `pyright` errors

### Changed

- Default temperature from `1.0` to `0.9`

## [0.1.3] 2023-06-25

### Added

- Ability to run terminal commands asynchronously
- Token count and price calculation

### Fixed

- The `cd code/<base_dir>;` command before running a terminal command was missing the `/` and therefore didn't work.
- Conversation history filenames in `history` folder are now incremented properly, even if some conversations are deleted
- Give error to GPT if it tries to replace text in a file that doesn't have the given text
- Create directory did not work because `directory` was passed to `codedir()` as a string instead of a variable
- Raise TypeErrors and NameErrors when calling OpenAI API

### Changed

- Version folder structure is now `versions/<incrementing_number>/v[1..]` as opposed to previous `versions/code_<timestamp>_v[1..]`.
- Formatted the output of the script nicer

## [0.1.2] 2023-06-24

### Fixed

- Issue #6: Iterating over a selected version didn't preserve its message history
- Issue #7: The `replace_text` function given to GPT didn't work with code

### Changed

- The `replace_text` function no longer uses regex because GPT can not properly format regex that includes code

## [0.1.1] 2023-06-23

### Added

- Support for Windows
- PyInstaller scripts for creating portable versions

### Fixed

- Script sometimes got stuck at "Waiting for ChatGPT..." when the GPT API stalled. Added `request_timeout` parameter to fix this (30 seconds)

## [0.1.0] 2023-06-23

### Added

- Better support for GPT-3.5 models
- More command line arguments
    - `--conv` to set previous conversation ID to continue from
    - `--prompt` to set initial prompt
    - `--delete` to delete existing code if present
    - `--versions` to create multiple versions of the same project at once
    - `--temp` to set temperature of GPT API
    - `--better` to automatically make prompt better with GPT
    - `--not-better` to not ask to make prompt better with GPT
    - `--ask-better` to ask for confirmation of using better prompt when automatically making better prompt
    - `--better-versions` to create a separate better prompt for every version

### Fixed

- API loop when invalid model was used in settings (issue #3)

### Changed

- Conversation ID is now set with `--conv` flag, instead of the first command line argument
